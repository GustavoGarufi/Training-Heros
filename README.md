# Training-Heros
Uploading my old Training Heros project.

This was a project originaly posted on 99Designs on 21/11/2015
I've uploaded it to have a new site on my resume and to showcase
some of my coding work from about one year ago. 

This project in particular was my first time using Jade, SASS and
JS on my own actual project, without relying on frameworks such as
BootStrap for the design. I also managed to create a Paralax scrolling
effect with mulitiple sections of full screen fixed backgrounds. 

Overall I feel very proud of this project because for me it was a 
first in alot of things.
